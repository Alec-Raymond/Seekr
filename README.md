## Seekr

Using Google Maps is boring. Using physical maps is outdated, impractical, and somewhat frustrating. This IOS app offers an option in the middle, with features that retain the fun of exploration while walking or biking around a place you don't know, while preventing you from getting lost and keeping you generally headed towards your destination.

- Login page:                           Seekr/Core/Authentication/View/LoginView
- Register new user page:               Seekr/Core/Authentication/View/RegistrationView
- User profile page:                    Seekr/Core/Profile/ProfileView
- User formatting page:                 Seekr/Model/User
- Text Field shortcut:                  Seekr/Components/InputView
- Settings Field shortcut:              Seekr/Components/SettingsRowView

Registration is working, Login is almost fully set up. Need to do the last linking.
